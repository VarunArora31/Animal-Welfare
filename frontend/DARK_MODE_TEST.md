# Dark Mode Testing Instructions

## Issue Fixed âœ…
The dark mode was showing by default instead of light mode. This has been resolved.

## What was fixed:
1. **Tailwind Config**: Added `darkMode: 'class'` to enable class-based dark mode
2. **Initial State**: App now starts in light mode by default
3. **localStorage**: Properly loads and saves dark mode preference
4. **Toggle Logic**: Fixed the toggle button to work correctly

## To test dark mode:

1. **Start the app**: The app should load in **light mode** by default
2. **Click the moon icon** in the top right to switch to **dark mode**
3. **Click the sun icon** to switch back to **light mode**
4. **Refresh the page**: Your preference should be remembered

## If you need to reset:

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('darkMode')
location.reload()
```

This will clear the saved preference and start fresh in light mode.

## Visual indicators:
- **Light mode**: Moon icon (gray)
- **Dark mode**: Sun icon (yellow)
- **Hover tooltips**: Show "Switch to Light/Dark Mode"
